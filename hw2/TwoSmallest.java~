/*Write your code in the file TwoSmallest.java. Write your test cases in assign2-testcases.txt.
 *
 *We wish to write a program that takes a set of numbers and determines which are the two smallest.
 *
 *Ask the user for the following information, in this order:
 *
 *A terminating value (real number). The user will enter this value again later, to indicate that he or she is finished providing input.
 *A sequence of real numbers. Keep asking for numbers until the terminating value is entered.
 *Compute and output the smallest and second-smallest real number, in that order. It is possible for the smallest and second-smallest numbers to be the same (if the sequence contains duplicate numbers).
 *
 *Example:
 *
 *java TwoSmallest
 *
 *123 [this is the terminating value, not part of the set of numbers]
 *17
 *23.5
 *10
 *15.2
 *30
 *8
 *16
 *123 [this is the terminating value again, indicating that the user is done]
 *
 *RESULT: 8.0
 *RESULT: 10.0
 *In ALL cases of error on input, RE-ASK the user for the input until it is correctly entered.
